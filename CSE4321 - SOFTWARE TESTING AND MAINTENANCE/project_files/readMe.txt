project of CSE4321 Spring 2021

This project requires students mainly to use graph-based testing techniques to analyze a given bug-injected Java code. Then use JUnit to write test methods to test the faulty code and fix bugs if found.  


Here are two folders: 
	project_related_files
	video_related_files


In folder project_related_files, there are two files: Printtokens__student.java and Printtokens_GUI.jar.

	Printtokens__student.java
	Printtokens__student.java is the Java code that has been injected many bugs. You should work on this code.
	when open it in an IDE like eclipse, rename it to "Printtokens.java"

	Printtokens_GUI.jar
	Printtokens_GUI.jar is an executable mini app that is designed to help create test case.
	to open it you need to have jre 8 installed in your operating system.


In folder video_related_files are files used in the videos recorded, which help understand what the project is on the sample code. highly recommend watching these videos before starting.
